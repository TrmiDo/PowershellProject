# PowershellProject
I wanted to upgrade my laptop to become a smarter and more convenient machine for my day-to-day use. Hence, I have developed a set of PowerShell scripts to automate various tasks.

1. Automatic Application Activation
Upon startin your machine, the script will automatically launch your desired applications. This way, you won't have to manually click on each app every time you start your computer.

2. Auto Delete
The script will take care of automatically deleting old files, helping you free up valuable space on your computer.

3. Smart Backup
To avoid deleting important files by the previous script, this scripts backups files that are frequently accessed or modified reducing chances of losing crucial data.

4. Services Checker
Managing background services on your computer can be time_consuming. My script can quickly scan through the running services an decide whether to stop or activate any of them.

To automate all this task. 
1. Go **Task Scheduler**
2. Click on **Action** and **Create Basic Task**
3. Choose how often/when you want the script to execute
